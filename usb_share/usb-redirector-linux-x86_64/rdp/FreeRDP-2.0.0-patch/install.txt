THIS PATCH IS FOR FreeRDP 2.0.0 to 2.3.2 (excluding 2.0.0-rc3 and 2.0.0-rc4 which are not supported)
Newer versions might work also, but they need testing.

1. Copy ./channels directory into FreeRDP source code directory.

2. Compile and install FreeRDP.

   Below are very basic instructions that allow compiling FreeRDP in default
   configuration. Please see FreeRDP compilation guide for more details and 
   options: https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/wiki/Compilation

   It is not necessary to install the whole FreeRDP if you already have it 
   installed. It is enough to copy ./channels/usbrdr/client/usbrdr-client.a
   module into FreeRDP plugins directory (usually /usr/local/lib/<system type>/freerdp2).

   Generate makefiles with default settings:
   cmake -GNinja .

   Compile:
   cmake --build .

   Install on the current system:
   cmake --build . --target install

   Build installation package for installing on another system:
   cmake --build . --target package

3. Start FreeRDP with '/vc:usbrdr' option.
