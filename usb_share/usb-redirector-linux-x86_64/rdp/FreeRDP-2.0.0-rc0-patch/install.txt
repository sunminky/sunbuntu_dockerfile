THIS PATCH IS FOR FreeRDP 2.0 starting from 2.0.0-rc0 and up to and including 2.0.0-rc2

1. Copy channels directory to FreeRDP source code directory.

2. Compile and install FreeRDP.

   See FreeRDP compilation guide at https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/wiki/Compilation
   It is not necessary to install the whole FreeRDP at this step if you already
   have it installed. It is enough to copy ./channels/usbrdr/client/usbrdr-client.a file
   to FreeRDP plugins directory (usually /usr/local/lib/<system type>/freerdp2 directory).

3. Start FreeRDP with '/vc:usbrdr' option.
